                <p>Thanks to REEP for letting STEP take a tour of your 
                    energy efficient home! It was an excellent demonstration

                    and be used in anyone's home! Interested in what you can 
                    do to make your home more energy efficient and how you 
                    can save both the environment and money? Take a look at

                    hosted UW Sustainable Technology Education Project&#39;s (STEP) 
                    Green Starlight Night 2009 this past Tuesday, November 10. 
                    The 8:00 p.m. start time marked the merging of environment 
                    lovers, music enthusiasts, and fun fanatics for a not-to-be 
                    forgotten night on the dance floor. The event sported performances 
                    by Sea to Sky, Circadian Rhythm, Punchalice, and DJ Furious 
                    George. The atmosphere throughout the night (and into the 
                    morning) was one of heavy bass and light hearted fun. Sea 
                    to Sky started the night off, and generated a positive buzz 
                    from its audience which carried over to the next performance 
                    by Circadian Rhythm. The five piece rock band that met while 
                    attending UW started with the classic Guns `N&#39; Roses song, 
                    "Sweet Child O&#39;Mine." They followed up with one of their 
                    originals, "Hard to Hate You" and brought out another crowd 
                    pleaser, Lady Gaga&#39;s "Just Dance." Punchalice, a "Po-Modern 
                    Alt-Geek" rock band two years into their career was the 
                    perfect finish to the night&#39;s lineup. Their high energy 
                    show stirred the crowd into a frenzy. Punchalice&#39;s "The 
                    Bottom Line" was a hit with the crowd, as was their version 
                    of MIA&#39;s "Paper Planes." Their insane energy level and interaction 
                    with the crowd made them a favourite of the night. They 
                    were even able to elicit mass participate in a &quot;best bad 
                    dancer&quot; dance-off, a highlight of the evening. DJ Furious 
                    George finished off the night by spinning out some old school 
                    beats which kept everyone on the dance floor till the early 
                    hours of the morning. Not to be outdone by all the musical 
                    talent, STEP brought out of their past projects, a human 
                    powered bike generator, onto the dance floor and pedaled 
                    out a striking light show. (Plagiarized from Imprint)</p>
