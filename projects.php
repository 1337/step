    <!--p>To encourage and inspire a movement towards sustainability, all of STEP's activities involve one or more of research, promotion, education, and demonstration. For a description about ongoing projects please click through the expandable windows below. To browse through some of our past accomplishments please see our completed projects.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in supporting STEP there are several ongoing projects that need volunteers and funding. Each of the projects are potential sources for 4th year engineering design projects and other academic projects. Funding is vital to the success of each of these; donations and money are all welcome contributions to each of these projects.</p-->

                    <p>STEP Partnered with consultant James Moore and worked with the The University of Waterloo to start a solar thermal demonstration project. The University of Waterloo has graciously purchased 15 Solcan solar thermal panels for heating water. The University is allowing STEP to perform the necessary engnieering required for performing the installation. Currently the plan is to install the panels on top of village one student residence. The panels will help heat the water for the cafeteria and student showers.</p>
                    <p>The project will show that the sun can be used for more than just supplying electricity. Your hot water, home heating pool water can be warmed by the sun. Excelent for both comercial and residential uses.</p>
                    <p>Solar thermal water heating is amongst the most economical renewable energy sources. One panel is sufficient to provide the needs of two people. There are several types, simple extruded plastic systems are quite popular for heating pool water. The more advanced coated flatplate copper collectors, are being employed for this installation. Evacuated tubes are the most efficient and will still collect heat in extreme cold conditions.</p>
                    <p>When STEP completes the installation a new project to monitor the performance will start. The results will be posted on the internet and educational signs posted outside. This way the general public can see the potential of solar thermal energy.</p>

But how difficult is it to produce electricity? This project aims to provide people with a better understanding of the difficulties associated with electricity generation. A prototype bicycle generator has been created by STEP that can power most AC devices to show people how much effort is required to power a 60W lightbulb, or charge an iPod. Currently the output of the generator is modified sine-wave power which limits its use to simple devices. A true-sine wave inverter was recently donated to the team which will allow us to power any electronic device that runs on AC power. Future plans also include upgrading the electrical system to allow multiple bicycles to produce power for a single outlet. Check out our gallery for more pictures of this project in action.</p>

                    <p>STEP and IEEE recently hosted a wind turbine competition for 1st year engineering students. Contestants were provided with materials to build a scale model wind turbine which would be tested in a wind tunnel in the Fluids Lab. Competitors were responsible for designing the turbine blades and supporting structure using the least amount of material needed while stile achieving the required strength. For pictures of the event please check out our gallery.</p>

                    <p>In January 2004, STEP volunteers came together to successfully install the first ever student designed solar array in Canada! The array installed on top of Federation Hall, consisted of 36 55–watt panels for a total power of 1.95 kW, purchased from Arise Technology. At the time, the array was expected to produce 1400 kWh a year—enough to power 2/3 of an energy-efficient home. STEP raised $40,000 from 22 generous UW and business community sponsors to complete the project. </p>
                    <p>Currently STEP is working towards power monitoring service to further extend the success of the solar photovoltaic (PV) Project. We would like to allow students and the public to see how the solar panels perform. By networking with the inverter STEP will provide real-time power generation for display on the Internet and on an LED sign in front of the array. This will help educate students and the public on the power production of the project and develop an understanding of how solar PV works. With weather data from the University of Waterloo weather station, students will be able to see how temperature, diffuse radiation and direct sunlight affects solar PV performance. </p>
