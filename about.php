                <p>STEP is based out of the University of Waterloo. It is a subgroup of
                            the larger University of Waterloo Sustainability Project (UWSP), and
                            is also fully affiliated with the Federation of Students and the
                            Faculty of Engineering. Our group is led by both undergraduate and
                            graduate students currently studying at the university. All projects
                            and initiatives are funded by generous donations from university-based
                            grants and local businesses. Being a university-based organization,
                            STEP is in a unique position to improve campus sustainability and to
                            contribute to research and education towards long-term benefits for
                            future generations.</p>

                <p>STEP was founded in 2002, initially as the "Solar Technology Education
                            Project." It's mandate was to design and fund the installation of
                            solar panels on a building on the university campus. In 2004 they
                            successfully installed a photovoltaic array atop Federation Hall. The
                            array remains fully operational to this day. STEP then became the
                            Sustainable Technology Education Project as the members of STEP
                            decided to continue the group and move on to more projects around
                            campus.</p>
                       <p>Following the success of the photovoltaic process the university
                            helped purchase 15 flatplate solar thermal collectors. STEP is
                            currently working to install these panels on one of the university's
                            student residences. STEP conducted a thorough research on the
                            feasibility of a wind turbine on campus. However due to lack of
                            faculty support, this project was placed on indefinite hiatus.</p>
                       <p>In the more recent years STEP has expanded its mandate to include
                            providing educational workshops to local high schools and the local
                            community. STEP frequently hosts guest speaker events and other
                            discussion forums at the university. Most notably, STEP provides
                            regular tours of renewable (and, for comparison, some non-renewable)
                            energy power generation facilities and sustainably designed homes such
                            as earthships.</p>
                       <p>In the Fall of 2009 STEP participated in the 2009 Solar Decathlon
                            organized by the United States Department of Energy as part of a
                            multi-university team from Ontario. The Team placed fourth in this
                            competition to design, construct, and operate an efficient and
                            attractive, fully-functional solar-powered house. Within a few weeks
                            STEP also held an event to celebrate the participation of the fashion
                            industry in a move towards sustainable design.</p>
                       <p>STEP is now focused on completing the Solar Thermal project and
                            exploring its opportunities for educating the public through workshops
                            and other interactive activities.</p>
